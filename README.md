Didnt have time for turorial so...

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
You fire your gun and your goal is to get the most score by killing enemies. Game ends once enemies get to you (thus survive).

Additionaly each time you do 360 (one 360 rotation is called flick for clarity) with your gun under 1s and without change of direction you enhacne your next shot
granting extra bounces and extra score per enemy (and also bigger screen shake) so best strategy would be to do as many flicks as you can while then fire your empovered shot tring to hit as many enemies as possible all while keping distance from enemies.

<h2>Controlls</h>
Gun rotates towards your cursor. Left click to fire your gun.

<h2>Ui</h2>
Lots of UI should be self explemantory, but:
<ul>
  <li>curent flick count with colors based on how many flick you did in ne second</li>
  <li>score with its addition</li>
  <li>realod bar under cursor when reloadint (with change of cursor for better visibility when you move your mouse rapidly)</li>
  <li>so called "radial" bar around player that indicates your flick progress, red bar is remaining time for next flick and yellow is remaining time for next multiflick (more flicks er second)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Cheats</h3>
I had kept basic cheats in final build
<ul>
  <li>F2 + 1 = set Time.scale to 1</li>
  <li>F2 + 2 = divide Time.scale by 2</li>
  <li>F2 + 3 = multiply Time.scale by 2</li>
  <li>Esc = restart game scene</li>
  <li>space = to skip intro video</li>
</ul>
