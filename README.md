Didnt have time for turorial so...

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
You fire your gun and your goal is to get the most score by killing enemies. Game ends once enemies get to you (thus survive).

Additionaly each time you do 360 (one 360 rotation is called flick for clarity) with your gun under 1s and without change of direction you enhacne your next shot
granting extra bounces and extra score per enemy (and also bigger screen shake) so best strategy would be to do as many flicks as you can then fire your empovered shot trying to hit as many enemies as possible all while keping distance from enemies. 

If you do more than one flick per second you gain multiflicks that multiply your shot power by number of curent flicks, but they last only 1 second so you have to get them last just before firing to get any bonuses. Average player should be able to get at least 1 to 3 multiflicks, if you are pro gamer you can get up to 5 more than that should be pretty much immposible.

<h2>Controlls</h2>
Gun rotates towards your cursor. Left click to fire your gun.

<h2>Ui</h2>
Lots of UI should be self explenatory, but:
<ul>
  <li>curent flick count with colors and under line based on number of current multiflicks</li>
  <li>score with its addition</li>
  <li>realod bar under cursor when reloading (with change of cursor for better visibility when you move your mouse rapidly)</li>
  <li>so called "radial" bar around player that indicates your flick progress, red bar is remaining time for next flick and yellow is remaining time for next multiflick</li>
</ul>


<h3>Cheats</h3>
I had kept basic cheats in final build
<ul>
  <li>F2 + 1 = set Time.scale to 1</li>
  <li>F2 + 2 = divide Time.scale by 2</li>
  <li>F2 + 3 = multiply Time.scale by 2</li>
  <li>Esc = restart game scene</li>
  <li>space = to skip intro video</li>
</ul>


<h4>WebGl</h4>
The webgl build should be playable but with some slight issues
<ul>
  <li>intro when you lunch game does not work</li>
  <li>custom cursors are absurdly big</li>
</ul>
apart from that it SHOULD be fine
